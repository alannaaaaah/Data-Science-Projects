Database Systems Comparison

## Project Overview

### Target

This project explores the Yelp dataset by setting up and analyzing data using both relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases. The goal is to gain insights into consumer experiences, business trends, and database performance comparisons.

### Results

Designed and developed two database structures in SQL and NoSQL. One a structured schema in PostgreSQL, enforcing relationships and constraints; the other leveraging MongoDB’s flexibility for semi-structured data. The dataset includes businesses, users, reviews, check-ins, and tips, allowing us to perform analytical queries on business popularity, top-rated businesses, and active users.

The project involved importing and transforming JSON data, schema design, and query optimization to compare SQL vs. NoSQL efficiency. We used DBeaver for database management and PyMongo for MongoDB queries. Ultimately, this project provided hands-on experience in database setup, data manipulation, and performance analysis.

### Deliverable

- A relational schema for a chosen dataset
- Two data systems of the chosen dataset
    - Relational data system [PSQL]
    - Non-relational data system [MongoDB]
- Five testing queries for data system evaluations
- Project Report
