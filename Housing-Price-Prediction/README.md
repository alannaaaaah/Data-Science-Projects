# Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

### Target

This project leverages machine learning to build a robust predictive model to estimate the monetary value of a home. By training on historical data of over 200K records collected by the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO), the model is able to predict new/unseen real estate prices. 

### Results

Using Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression, the models were trained and tested on a diverse dataset. The models showed varying degrees of accuracy, with Random Forest Regression providing the most reliable predictions across multiple price ranges. This analysis highlights the models' potential to assist real estate stakeholders in making informed decisions based on predictive insights.
